# One on One

One on One is an application to choose NBA players and compare their statistics to their generation. The application is built on a Mongo and Mongoose backend and a React frontend  and pulls from our API of 50 NBA players and their stats relative to their era or more specifically their active years played in the league. This application is designed to present arguments for players and their dominance in a measured way.
